The old oak tree stood at the edge of the meadow, its gnarled branches reaching out like the hands of forgotten ancestors.
Beneath its thick canopy, shadows danced as the wind whispered through the leaves, carrying secrets from faraway lands.
A small stream trickled nearby, its clear waters weaving through the stones like a path of forgotten memories.
As the sun dipped low in the sky, the air was filled with the scent of wildflowers and earth, a reminder that even in stillness, life is always moving.
