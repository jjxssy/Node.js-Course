The wind howled through the cracks in the old barn, sending a chill through the empty space.
The wooden beams groaned as though they, too, were weary from years of standing alone.
Outside, the sky was an endless expanse of gray, a blanket of clouds that seemed to stretch on forever.
A lone raven perched atop the roof, watching the world below with an unsettling stillness.
In the corner of the barn, a forgotten bicycle lay half-covered in hay, its rusted frame telling stories of adventures long past.
The air smelled faintly of earth and damp wood, and somewhere in the distance, a train whistle echoedâ€”a reminder of places far beyond this quiet, abandoned corner of the world.
