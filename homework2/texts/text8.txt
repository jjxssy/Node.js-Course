The old house stood at the edge of the hill, its silhouette barely visible against the darkening sky.
The windows, once bright with the glow of laughter and light, were now just darkened eyes staring out into the overgrown yard.
A rusted gate creaked in the wind, its hinges protesting with every gust.
The trees around the house whispered softly, their branches scraping against the roof as though trying to wake it from its long slumber.
In the garden, wildflowers had taken over, their bright colors a stark contrast to the peeling paint of the house.
The air smelled of damp earth and forgotten memories, and for a moment, it felt as though time itself had paused, waiting for something—or someone—to return.
The ocean stretched out before me, a vast, endless expanse of blue that seemed to merge with the sky at the horizon. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was a constant, soothing rhythm, like the heartbeat of the earth itself. Each wave that rolled in seemed to carry with it a story, a whisper from the deep that only the sea could tell. The salty breeze tugged at my hair, and I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the cool air fill my lungs, feeling the weight of the world lighten with each breath.
I walked along the edge of the beach, the sand soft beneath my feet, leaving a trail of footprints that would soon be washed away by the next wave. The ocean had a way of making everything feel temporary, as though nothing could last long enough to matter. Yet, at the same time, there was a timeless quality to it—the way the waves had been coming and going for millennia, the way the tides moved with the pull of the moon, the way the sun rose and set over the water without fail.
Far off in the distance, a seagull cried out, its call lost in the wind. The shore was mostly empty now, save for a few scattered shells and the occasional fisherman mending his nets. As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the sand, I found myself drawn to the water’s edge. The tide was slowly coming in, the water lapping at my ankles as I stood there, feeling the coolness of the ocean on my skin.
It was easy to get lost in the beauty of it all—the simplicity of the waves, the colors of the sky fading from gold to pink to purple. The ocean had a way of quieting everything else, drowning out the noise of the world, leaving only the present moment. There was no rush here, no need to hurry. Everything seemed to happen in its own time.
As I stood there, gazing out over the water, I couldn’t help but think about the vastness of the ocean—the way it held so many mysteries beneath its surface, so much life and movement hidden from view. How many stories were out there, just beneath the waves, waiting to be discovered? How many ships, forgotten for centuries, lay in the depths, their wooden bones entwined with coral and sand?
The sun was almost gone now, sinking below the horizon, and the sky above the ocean turned to a deep, velvety blue, dotted with the first stars of the evening. The air was cooler now, and the wind had picked up, tugging at the edges of my clothes. I turned to head back toward the small cottage behind me, but I took one last look at the ocean, at the way the light danced on the surface of the water. It was a sight I could never get tired of—one that seemed to reset something deep inside of me each time I saw it.
With a final glance at the waves, I turned and walked back, the sound of the ocean still echoing in my ears, carrying me forward into the evening.
