The moon hung low in the sky, casting silver threads across the quiet town.
Windows flickered with the soft glow of lamps, while the streets seemed to hum with the echoes of unseen footsteps.
Somewhere, a dog barked in the distance, its sound swallowed by the vast expanse of night.
In a small alleyway, a cat watched from the shadows, its eyes glowing like twin embers.
The scent of fresh rain lingered in the air, mingling with the faint trace of coffee and cinnamon that drifted from an open bakery window.
Time slowed, and for a moment, everything felt suspended, as though the world itself was taking a breath.
