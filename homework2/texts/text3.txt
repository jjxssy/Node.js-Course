The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its rhythmic sound filling the otherwise silent room.
Outside, the sky was a deep shade of violet, streaked with the last traces of a setting sun.
A crow cawed in the distance, its voice echoing across the empty fields.
Inside, an old book lay open on the table, its pages yellowed with age, yet still holding stories untold.
A single candle flickered in the corner, casting long, wavering shadows across the walls.
The air smelled faintly of tobacco and pine, a reminder of distant forests and forgotten paths.
It was a moment out of time, suspended between dusk and something far more eternal.
